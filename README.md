###### Change Log

###### 2 February 2016

- Major clean up of ontology
- Removed all old imports, as they were introducing a lot of unecessary properties and classes
- Imported (with owl:import) models that are of great usage to us as a whole:
 - Added spatial attributes into the ontology by importing WGS84 Geo Positioning (geo)
 - Added by data authorization facet/module by importing PPO ontology
 - Added ontology author description etc
- Added temporal aspects to the ontology by adding one new class (Timeslice) and a new object property (hasTimeslice)
